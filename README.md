Theme Sci-Fi Infinite Scroller made in Unity, going with the style of
2 D perspective with 3D world. Which means the game will have a combination of 
2D artwork as well as 3D models within the world, for inspiration please take a
look at "JeyPack Joy Ride Sci-fi like Artwork!" or the ideas from other side scrollers
that are infinite runners like flappy bird, etc..
